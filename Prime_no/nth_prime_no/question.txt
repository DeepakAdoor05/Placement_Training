Write a program that finds the nth prime number. 
The program should take an integer 𝑛 as input and output the 𝑛-th prime number. 
For example, 
if 𝑛 is 4, the program should return 7, since 7 is the 4th prime number in the sequence (2, 3, 5, 7, ...)

Examples:

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 7
Explanation: 7 is the 4th prime number.

Example 2:

Input: n = 6
Output: 13
Explanation: 13 is the 6th prime number.
