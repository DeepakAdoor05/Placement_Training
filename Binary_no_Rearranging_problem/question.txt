Given Two binary numbers (in 0 and 1) in the form of string. 
Find the possibility whether these numbers can become equial by rearranging their 
respective 0's and 1's.     (TCS NQT 2022)
for ex: 101 and 011 can be arranged within themselves to become either 101 and 011.
Example 1:
3 -> length of input string
101 -> input string 1
011 -> input string 2
Output 1 : Yes

Example 2:
5 -> length of input string
10100 -> input string 1
01111 -> input string 2
Output 2 : No
